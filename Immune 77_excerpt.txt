Today is Cindy's turn to do a paper. So Cindy, go for it.
All right. So I picked a mouthful of a paper. It's called Transendothelial Neutrophil
Migration Activates Bactericidal Function via PISO-1 Mechanosensing.
I thought this was really cool because if you take nothing else away, the idea is
neutrophils need to come out of the blood and into the tissues in order to be able to
find and kill bacteria. And this paper suggests that when they go through the endothelium,
they get squished. And when they get squished, it activates their antibacterial program.
Right. I thought this was so cool. I've taught the process of transendothelial migration
a million times. You always kind of see in the images the cell has to get squished,
but the squishing matters. It does. It matters so much. The squishing does something. That's so
cool. And it's a lot of squishing. I mean, okay. So I wore my neutrophil necklace. Oh,
beautiful. So those of you can see. So neutrophils have a multilobular nucleus.
And I never thought about why that might be. So nuclei are usually nice and juicy and
round. And granulocytes like neutrophils have these lobular nuclei that have little
bubbles and then thin area, a little bubble and thin area. And if you think about it,
that's a pretty good idea if you're going to have to squish your nucleus.
Absolutely. Because it's a whole lot thinner in order to get through that little spot.
Right. That makes so much sense. I hadn't thought about that until you just said it.
And that's amazing.
